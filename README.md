### Course Description
Recent advances in 3D digital geometry processing have created a plenitude of novel concepts for the mathematical representation and interactive manipulation of geometric models. This course covers some of the latest developments in geometric modeling and digital geometry processing. Topics include surface modeling based on polygonal meshes, surface reconstruction, mesh improvement, mesh parametrization, discrete differential geometry, and interactive mesh generation. The students will learn how to design, program and analyze algorithms and systems for 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.

You will learn basic geometry processing concepts and sub-topics.

By the end of the course, you will be able to read and familiar with algorithms and systems for 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.

### Prerequisites
This course requires you having a good programming skill in C++ and a good knowledge of math, such as linear algebra (vector operations, matrices, solving systems of linear equations, polynomials, etc), and calculus (derivative, integrals, etc). Talk to me if you really want to learn Geometry Processing and Graphics but not sure if you can survive the homework and the final project of the course.
